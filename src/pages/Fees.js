          My fees are £65 for up to a 1 hour session within a 30 mile roundtrip
          of Hambridge, Somerset. (40p per mile extra, if further than this.)
          This can include horses, dogs, family members and black background
          images if the situation allows. This session could also be used to
          documenting a show or training session.
        </p>

          Following image download, enhancement and selection of the best shots
          I will send you 10 small watermarked images.
