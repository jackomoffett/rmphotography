          The only thing I wanted when I was small was a pony. Thankfully,
          growing up in the countryside near Taunton, Somerset, meant I was able
          to help others look after and ride theirs. I have kept horses, off and
          on, for the rest of my adult life, along with dogs. My parents were
          keen photographers and so a passion for photography also emerged. I
          have found a real love of attempting to capture the essence of dogs
          and horses in photographs, with and without their owners. I hope you
          enjoy viewing my images as much as I enjoyed making them and if you
          are interested in having some photos taken, please contact me. Rache
